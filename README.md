# Werehog Mod (pre-merge)
This is the source code for the Werehog mod, which attempts to turn Classic Sonic into an accurate Werehog. This repository in particular contains the source code for the mod as it was before it got merged into the Unleashed Conversion repo.
The mod itself is extremely unfinished, as its development was halted in Januray 2025 after being told about Unleashed Recomp privately.
